    "This problem essentially boils down to finding the closest two points out of 2,000,000 randomly distributed points. The number of possible distances to check is then $\\frac{n^2-n}{2}$ which is way to large to effectively search. Instead I sort the points in accending order of their x position. Next I begin finding shortest distances. The big optimization step is that as soon as the gap on the x axis between the points, a, b, we are checking gets larger than our minimum distance, we can throw out the rest of the points to check with a, since each succesive point will be further along the x axis. Thus assuming the points are roughly uniformly distributed along the x axis from 1 - 50,515,093, we cut the search space for each point from an average of 1,000,000 to an average of 4, since we almost instantly find a distance of less than 250.
