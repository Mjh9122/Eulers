# Eulers
## Michael Holtz
Some selected project euler solutions written in python all code is mine unless stated otherwise in the problem.
For a quick summary, look at the Highlighted Solutions folder for a few solutions I am proud of.
Most of the solutions represent a just get the right answer mindset, and some solutions will take hours, as I wrote them to run in the backround while working on other problems.
